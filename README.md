# Contacts

This project is a React Native Contacts Application that I developed as a practice project to hone my skills in React Native development. <br> <br> <strong>Features</strong> <li>Fetch Contacts, <li>Create New Contacts, <li>Delete Contacts, and <li>Call a Number Directly from the app. 

The goal of this project was to create a simple and intuitive interface that would allow users to easily manage their contacts. I utilized several third-party libraries such as the React Native Contacts library to fetch the user's device contacts and display them within the application. The application also features the ability to create new contacts and edit existing ones, making it easy for users to keep their contact list up-to-date.

To make the user experience more seamless, I also included the ability to call a contact's phone number directly from within the application. With just a few taps, users can initiate a phone call without ever having to leave the app.

Another key feature of this application is the ability to delete contacts. With a simple swipe, users can remove a contact from their list, making it easy to keep their contact list organized.

Overall, this React Native Contacts Application demonstrates my proficiency in React Native development and my ability to utilize third-party libraries to create a functional and efficient application. Though it was a practice project, I believe that it could be useful for anyone who needs to manage their contacts in a more streamlined way.
